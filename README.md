**Homestay Price Prediction Model**

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting the price of homestays based on real-world data.

**Model Accuracy**

The current model achieves an accuracy of 50.26% on the given dataset. 

**Data**


* **Features:** 
    *  ["Number of bedrooms", "Number of bathrooms", "number of people accomodated", "cancellation policy", "cleaning fee", "Reviews", "no of beds"] 
* **Target Variable:** Price per night of the homestay

**Model**

* **Type:** Linear Regression
* **Training:** ["Trained on 80% of the dataset", "Used k-fold cross-validation for model evaluation"]




**Future Work**

* **Improve model accuracy:** 
    * Explore different model architectures (e.g., neural networks).
    * Conduct more thorough feature engineering and selection.
    * Fine-tune hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search.
* **Enhance data quality:** 
    * Collect more data to increase the sample size and improve model generalization.
    * Address potential biases in the data.
* **Create a user-friendly interface:** 
    * Develop a web application or API for easy interaction with the model.
